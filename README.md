# OCP
Open Cryptanalysis Platform

The OCP tool is composed of 4 files:
- tool.py: main file of the tool. You can launch here scripts to analyse your primitive. 
- operators.py: contains the various operators that can be used to build the modelisation of a primitive. You can add here new operators if needed, or add new ways for the operators to be modeled.
- primitives.py: contains the modelisation of various primitives. You can add here your own primitive if not already present.
- variables.py: contains the variable class
